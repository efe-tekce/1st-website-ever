        Ermias Joseph Asghedom (August 15, 1985 – March 31, 2019), known
        professionally as Nipsey Hussle (often stylized as Nipsey Hu$$le), was
        an American rapper, activist, and entrepreneur. Hussle became known for
        his numerous mixtapes, including his Bullets Ain't Got No Name series,
        The Marathon, The Marathon Continues, and Crenshaw, the last of which
        American rapper Jay-Z bought 100 copies for $100 each. After much delay,
        his debut studio album Victory Lap was released in 2018 to critical
        acclaim and commercial success, and was nominated for the Best Rap Album
        at the 61st Grammy Awards in 2019. Two posthumous Grammy Awards for the
        songs "Racks in the Middle" and "Higher" were awarded to Hussle in the
        Best Rap Performance and Best Rap/Sung Performance categories,
        respectively, the next year at the 62nd Grammy Awards.
